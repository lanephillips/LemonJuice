    <h1>Using Get Paid</h1>

    <h2>Addresses</h2>

    <p>The Addresses tab lists the balances of the addresses you are following. Balance information is downloaded from Blockchain.info. You may add an address by tapping the <b>+</b> button. This launches a QR scanner to scan an address in the form of a QR code. You may cancel the scanner to enter the address manually. You can assign a nickname to an address to make it easier to tell apart in the table. Press the <i>Edit</i> button to delete or rearrange the addresses. Pull down on the table to refresh the balances.</p>

    <p>When you add an address you can choose to be notified whenever an address is used to send or receive bitcoins.</p>

    <p>Tapping on an address in the table opens a list of recent transactions using that address. You may also choose to toggle notifications from this screen.</p>

    <p>Free users may track up to 5 addresses. To track unlimited addresses you can sign up for an inexpensive subscription. By subscribing, you are supporting continued development and improvement of the app.</p>


    <h2>Transactions</h2>

    <p>The transactions tab lists recent transactions for all the addresses you are watching. Only the most recent transactions are downloaded, so for highly active addresses, not all transaction may be visible. Pull down on the table to refresh the transaction list.</p>
